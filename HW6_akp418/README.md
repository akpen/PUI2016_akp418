##HW6_Assignment_1_Building_EnergyL

I have worked on this Assignment independently. Took some Assistance from Priyanshi to debug my code on linmodel_6.

I have provided comments on my jupyter notebook where ever required.

##HW6_Assignment_2_Citibike_Paper on Authorea:

The IPython Notebook is integrated with the Jupyter icon-image in the paper itself

good work on the analysis in place and tests appropriately chosen and performed.
please look at the comments on the Authorea article though. Mostly the issues are issues with the linguistics organization, and wording. I recommand you read a few articles, say 1/week, from science journals like PLOSOne to understand scientific writing a bit better.
